In order for examples to work you need to set up
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable.

You can either:
* add APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING to your user profile environment variables.
* create `examples/.env` file with variables which would be merged.
  `.env` is ignored in source control.
